# GPCHAR

GPCHAR is a python script made to best work with Kali Linux that allows you to generate wordlists. However, it is different than the other wordlist generators because you can choose what characters can be allowed in each position of the output words.

## Installing

In order to run the program correctly, you must have python3 installed and have your Linux updated.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

```
